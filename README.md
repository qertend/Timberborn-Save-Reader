# Installing
After downloading and unpacking the .zip file, run `install.bat`.  
It seems `install.bat` trips Avast's Behaviour shield protection
and potentially other anitvirus software you'll either have to:

### 1:
Add `install.bat` as an exception to your antivirus software

or

### 2: 
Run the commands listed below in the Timberborn save reader directory  
install node JS
    winget install node.js  

install node modules 
    npm i
