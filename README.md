After downloading and unpacking the .zip file, run `install.bat`.

It seems `install.bat` trips Avast's Behaviour shield protection

and potentially other antivirus software you'll either have to:

## 1:

Add `install.bat` as an exception to your antivirus software
  

## 2:

Run the commands listed below in the Timberborn save reader directory

#### install node JS

	winget install node.js

#### install node modules

	npm i

# Using the program
### Launching the program
Simply run `start.bat` to start the program
