# Installing

  

After downloading and unpacking the .zip file, run `install.bat`.

  

It seems `install.bat` trips Avast's Behaviour shield protection

  

and potentially other antivirus software you'll either have to:

  

## 1:

  

Add `install.bat` as an exception to your antivirus software

  

## 2:

  

Run the commands listed below in the Timberborn save reader directory

  

#### install node JS

  

	winget install node.js

  

#### install node modules

  

	npm i

  

#### Specify save directory

Create `Timberborn_save_location.txt`, and write in it the path to the folder Timberborn uses to store worlds and save files

The default location is 

> C:\Users\[user]\documents\Timberborn\Saves\

  
  

# Using the program

### Launching the program

Simply run `start.bat` to start the program
